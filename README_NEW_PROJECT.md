## 📦 What to Keep from This Project

If starting a similar project, you might want to keep:
- `netlify.toml` structure (adapt for new project)
- `package.json` dependencies (select what you need)
- SQL schema ideas (adapt for new database)
- Component structure (if using React)

## 🗑️ What Can Be Removed

For a completely new project:
- All SQL files (project-specific)
- Blog-related components (if not needed)
- Supabase configuration (if using different DB)
- Project-specific content

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Decide on new project type**
   - Same stack (Vite + React)?
   - Different framework?
   - Different database?

2. **Prepare workspace**
   - Create new folder
   - Initialize new repository
   - Set up new dependencies

3. **Start coding!**
   - Use this project as reference if needed
   - All documentation is saved in GitHub

---

**You're all set!** The current project is documented and saved. Ready to start your new project whenever you are.
